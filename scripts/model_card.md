# tetrak_hy — Armenian text recognition for EasyOCR

An Armenian text recogniser packaged as an
[EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) custom model, trained by
[tetrak-hy-trainer](https://github.com/scattercode/tetrak-hy-trainer)
for [Tetrak](https://tetrak.dev/), an OCR pipeline for community
archives. The architecture is EasyOCR's own generation2 recognition
network (VGG feature extractor, two BiLSTM layers, CTC head), so the
model drops into a stock EasyOCR install.

## Status: v0, alpha

These are the v0 spike weights, trained entirely on synthetic word
crops. On the held-out synthetic validation set they reach 99.72%
word accuracy (0.998 normalised edit distance). **They have not yet
been measured on real scans**, and real scanned pages are harder than
synthetic crops in every way that matters. A v1 trained on augmented
multi-word line crops is planned; treat v0 as a proof of the delivery
path, not a production recogniser.

## Files

- `tetrak_hy.pth` — the weights exactly as the trainer saved them
  (keys carry the `module.` prefix EasyOCR's loader expects to
  handle). This is the file EasyOCR loads.
- `model.safetensors` — the same tensors with the `module.` prefix
  stripped, for anything that isn't EasyOCR.
- `tetrak_hy.yaml` — charset, language list and network parameters.
- `tetrak_hy.py` — the architecture module EasyOCR imports by name.
- `provenance.json` — training recipe, dataset revision, charset and
  checksums for this release.

## Use with EasyOCR

Download the three EasyOCR files and place them where EasyOCR looks
for custom models:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

for filename in ("tetrak_hy.pth", "tetrak_hy.py", "tetrak_hy.yaml"):
    hf_hub_download("tetrak/easyocr-armenian", filename, revision="v0")
```

- `tetrak_hy.yaml` and `tetrak_hy.py` go in the user network
  directory (by default `~/.EasyOCR/user_network/`).
- `tetrak_hy.pth` goes in the model directory (by default
  `~/.EasyOCR/model/`).

Then:

```python
import easyocr

reader = easyocr.Reader(["en"], recog_network="tetrak_hy")
results = reader.readtext("page.png")
```

Note the `["en"]`: with a custom `recog_network`, the language list
selects EasyOCR's dictionaries rather than the model — the recogniser
itself is chosen by `recog_network`, and this model's charset covers
Armenian plus basic Latin, digits and punctuation.

Pin `revision=` when downloading: each weights release is tagged, and
`provenance.json` records the exact dataset revision it was trained
from.

## Training data

Trained on the `crops` configuration of
[tetrak/armenian-ocr-crops](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tetrak/armenian-ocr-crops):
synthetic word crops rendered from proofread Armenian Soviet
Encyclopedia text (Armenian Wikisource, CC BY-SA) in Noto Sans and
Noto Serif Armenian (SIL Open Font Licence 1.1). The exact dataset
revision is in `provenance.json`.

## Licence

The weights, like the trainer, are Apache 2.0. The training text is
CC BY-SA; we publish the text itself, share-alike, in the dataset
repository above, and take the position — shared by most of the
ecosystem, though not legally settled — that trained weights are not
a redistribution or adaptation of the training text.
